# Element_Tester
A small program to make the process of finding the right elements and selectors easier.

I made this because it was a pain to rerun my entire program every time I wanted to see if I had gotten the correct elements or selector. 
Not anymore!

With this program you just:
1. Input the URL, tag, attribute(optional) and value(optional).
2. Hit submit.
3. Output of the element(s) you chose.
